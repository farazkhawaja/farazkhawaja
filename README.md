# Hey there I'm Faraz

I’m a tech enthusiast who enjoys building things that solve real problems. I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I’m driven by curiosity and the constant desire to get better.

### What I enjoy:
- Breaking down complex systems into something understandable
- Learning from the community and giving back when I can

### My mindset
I believe good engineering is about more than just code — it's about **communication, curiosity, and care**. I'm a big believer in **open collaboration** and the value of learning, sharing, and building together with the community.

###  Let’s connect
I'm always open to exploring new ideas, contributing to meaningful projects, or teaming up to build something cool. Feel free to check out my work, open an issue, or just say hi.
